# Simple Ready Check for World of Warcraft Classic

## Description
This addon provides a small button to initiate a ready check.
It may be useful if you're using UI addons, which disable the default raid interface and still want to have a ready check button.
The button will be hidden if you're not in a party or raid and will appear when you join one. It has no options and can be dragged around like any other button with a shift + left click, without a shift it will be locked in place. To initiate a ready check, simply click the button.

## Installation
Simply copy the `SimpleReadyCheck` folder into your `Interface/AddOns` folder and select the addon in the AddOn menu of the character selection screen.
